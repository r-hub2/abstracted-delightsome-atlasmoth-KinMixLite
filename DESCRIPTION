Description: Methods for inference about/under complex relationships using
  peak height data from DNA mixtures: the most basic example would be testing whether a contributor to 
  a mixture is the father of a child of known genotype. This provides most of the functionality
  of the 'KinMix' package, but with some loss of efficiency and restriction on problem size,
  as the latter uses 'RHugin' as the Bayes net engine, while this package uses 'gRain'.
  The package implements the methods introduced in 
  Green, P. J. and Mortera, J. (2017) <doi:10.1016/j.fsigen.2017.02.001> and 
  Green, P. J. and Mortera, J. (2021) <doi:10.1111/rssc.12498>.
